Education
======
* B.S. in Electronics and communication engineering, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Sep. 2012 - Jun. 2016
* M.S. in Communication and signal processing, Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications, Sep. 2016 - Jun. 2019
* Ph.D in Cyber science and engineering, Southeast University, Sep. 2019 - Mar. 2024.

Work experience
======
* Postdoctoral Fellow, Queen's University Belfast，Mar. 2025 - Present

Project
======
* National Key Research and Development Program of China, Joint research of IoT security system and key
technologies based on the quantum key (No. 2020YFE0200600): (Work in progress) Key generation establishes
cryptographic keys between legitimate users by extracting randomness from their common channels. The application of Wi-Fi
protocol-based key generation ensures the secure transmission of quantum keys from the base station to the user’s equipment.
* National Natural Science Foundation of China, Research on quantum key distribution-based security
technology for 5G Internet of Things (No. U22B2026): (Work in progress) The implementation of a 5G protocol-based
key generation scheme for secure quantum key transmission over wireless channels.
